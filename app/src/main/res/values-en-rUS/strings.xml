    <string name="info_duochrome_test">
        A Duochrome Test is commonly used to estimate whether you are long or short sighted (or whether the lenses you are wearing are too weak or too strong). This test works on the principle that the wavelengths of red and green light are focused slightly differently by the eye, red being closer to the ratina with short sight (i.e. clearer) and green focused closer to the retina in long sight.
        \nNotes:
        \n1.The duochrome test is of no value, if your visual acuity is atleast 20/40 or better.
        \n2. The duochrome test is usually not applicable at a young age (under 20), since the characters will appear clearly on both sides. This test is usually advised at an older age and/or in case of vision problems.
        \nInstructions!!!
        \n1.Perform the test in natural light. Artificial light dilates the pupil, which increases the chromatic aberration in the eye.
        \n2.Hold your phone approximately 40 cm from your eyes (strech your arms, or place the phone/tablet on something). The center of the screen should be approximately at the level of eyes. If you wear eyeglasses or contact lenses, do not take them off.
        \n3.Cover your left eye with your left hands.
        \n4.Look at the letters on the red side then look at the letters in the green side.If you see the letters on the red background with greater contrast and blacker, it means you are short-sighted. Now cover your right eye with your right hand and do the same.

    <string name="info_astigmatism_test">
    Astigmatism is a vision condition that cause blurred vision due either to the irregular shape of the cornea, the clear front cover of the eye, or sometimes the curvature of the lens inside the eye. In this case the cornea is not fully a circular dome, but it is shaped more like a football.
    \nAstigmatism makes it difficult to see fine details, either close up or from a distance. If you have uncorrected astigmatism, you can have varios symptoms such as blurry vision, eyestrain, tired eyes or headaches. Astigmatism can be quickly and easily corrected with eyeglasses, astigmatic contact lenses or laser surgery.
    \nInstructions!!!
        \n1.Hold your phone approximately 40 cm from your eyes. The centre of the screen should be approximately at the level of your eyes. Test one eye at a time.
        \n2.On the next screen observe each lines or squares carefully.
        \n3. Are all the lines black in color and are equally thick? Are all the squares in the same black in color? Or does one or more colors appear gray?
        \nIf you see some lines gray or distorted, you may have astigmatism.

    <string name="info_amslergrid_test">
        The Amsler grid is a grid of horizontal and vertical lines used to monitor a person\'s central visual field. It is a diagnostic tool that aids in the detection of visual disturbances caused by changes in the retina, particularly the macula, as well as the optic nerve and the visual pathway to the brain.
        \nInstructions
        \n1. Place your phone approx. 40 cm from your eyes with the grid set at eye level.
        \n2. Look at the dot in the center of the grid.
        \n3. Cover your left eye with your left hand while continuing to look at the dot with your right eye. Do not move your gaze from the dot.
        \n4. Did the dot or squares around the dot change shapes or disappear when you covered one eye? Do you see any blur or distortion in the grid?
        \n5. Now repeat all steps, covering your right eye.
        \n6. Click Start to do the test.</string>

    <string name="info_color_blindness_test">The Color Blindness test is a test to measure your ability to perceive differences between colours. Color blindness is most often of genetic nature, but may also occur because of eye, nerve, or brain damage, or due to exposure to certain chemicals.
    \nInstructions
    \n1. Place your phone approx. 40 cm from your eyes with each circle set at eye level.
    \n2. Try to identify the hidden number within 5 seconds, however there is no time limit. Then click the image to see the answer with an analysis.
    \n3. Swipe the screen to the side and go to the next test

    <string name="info_landolt_C_chart_headline">What is a Landolt C chart?</string>
    <string name="info_landolt_C_chart">Landolt C: Also known as the Landolt ring or broken ring, this chart features circles with a gap on one side.

This test is considered highly accurate and is often used in research and for people who are not familiar with the Latin alphabet.</string>

    <string name="info_snellen_chart_headline">what is a Snellen Chart</string>
    <string name="info_snellen_chart">Snellen chart: The most common type of eye chart, the Snellen chart displays rows of letters that decrease in size from top to bottom. The person being tested reads the smallest line of letters they can see clearly. This chart is used to measure visual acuity, with results expressed as a fraction (e.g., 20/20).</string>

    <string name="info_snellen_number_chart_headline">what is a Snellen "Number" Chart?</string>
    <string name="info_snellen_number_chart">A Snellen "Number" Eye Chart is a variation of the traditional Snellen chart that uses numbers instead of letters. This makes it suitable for people who do not know the Latin alphabet or for young children who have not yet learned to read. Like the standard Snellen chart, the numbers are arranged in decreasing sizes from top to bottom. The person being tested identifies the smallest row of numbers they can clearly see, determining their visual acuity.</string>
